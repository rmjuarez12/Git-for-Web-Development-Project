        A: A class is used when you want to use a name several times, while an id is used a single time in the page.
        For a class example, let's say we will create several blocks in the page that uses blue bg, and another set that uses red. You can specify a blue class and a red class, and you can use it to as many block elements as you need.
        For an id example, let's say you need to use styling to a single block that is very important. You can use an id to make sure that it is applied to only that one element.

        A: If the div already has the style and color already specified, you could use "border-width: 1px". Otherwise, if you need to specify it all, you can use "border: 1px dotted black".

    29. How do I select everything on the page?

    34. Why should I use version control? 
        A: Version control is important to keep track of changes within your project, and keep every team member working off the latest version. This helps avoid any issues where someone may be working on a file and either overwrote someone else's work, or is using a version with missing code.
        
    35. How often should I commit to github?
        A: Very often, as each commit helps you keep track of your progress, and gives you a "checkpoint" to return to should things go south. 

    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
        A: **git push -u origin branch-name**(where branch-name is the branch YOU are working from) will push all of your commits from your local machine up onto github.

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
        - First, we will "fork" the repo that we will use to work on.
        - Second, we add our TL as a collaborator on your forked Repo.
        - Third, we clone the repo we forked and copy it to our computer.
        - Fourth, we create our own branch name, which is the one we will commit and push our changes to.
        - Fifth, once we have the assignment finished, we go ahead and add, commit, then push the changes to the repo under the new branch we created.
        - Sixth, we go ahead and create a pull request on Github, and we add out TL so he can review it, and later do the merge.

        A Note, before you make a pull request, you have to make sure you are doing the request for the forked repo, and not the original one.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        A: An inline element is placed side to side when displayed on the browser. A block element takes the full width of the line it is in, moving all other elements below it.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
        A: When an element is positioned absolute, it no longer is stacked on the document in relation to the other elements. It pretty much sits on its own layer.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        A: You set the element to "display: inline-block".

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        A: Elements displayed block by default: div, p, section.
        Elements displayed inline by default: input, textarea
        Element displayed inline-block by default: button

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        A: The box model is what is used to represent the spacing in an element. This spacing can be done using margins, padding, and border. However, there are some type of elements that do not respect a width you have specified, which are the inline elements. In order to fix this, you have to use either block or inline-block for the display property.
